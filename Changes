  [ Christian Hofstaedtler ]
  * Remove Christopher Sacca <csacca@thecsl.org> from Uploaders.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Use Dpkg::Source::Package's get_default_diff_ignore_regex() function
    instead of the deprecated $diff_ignore_default_regexp string.
    Thanks to Guillem Jover for the bug report. (Closes: #834199)

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * debian/source/format: switch to '3.0 (native)'.
    Cf. the thread at https://lists.debian.org/debian-perl/2016/03/msg00038.html
    for the history and pros/cons of having a non-native vs. a native package.
  * Drop debian/{watch,upstream-signing-key.pgp,source/include-binaries}.
    Not needed for a native package.
  * Add a lintian override for latest-debian-changelog-entry-changed-to-
    native.
  * Debian::Control::FromCPAN: find_debs_for_modules(): exit version loop.
    When searching for versioned dependency, the method issues the warning
    "$module package in APT ($d) does not satisfy $dep" even when higher
    versions are available. Exit the loop as soon as we have a high enough
    version.
  * Issue a warning in build_package if local::lib usage is detected.
    local::lib sets the installation path (by default to $HOME/perl5) via
    PERL_MB_OPT/PERL_MM_OPT which is not what we want in the built
    package. Messing with the environment is a bit too brittle, so we
    issue a fat warning and give recommendations for deactivating the
    local::lib environment temporarily.
    Thanks to Jacob L Anawalt for the bug report. (Closes: #820395)
  * debian/copyright: change Copyright-Format 1.0 URL to HTTPS.
  * DhMakePerl::Utils: when checking for core modules, look at current
    perl.
    Various helpers which check if a module is in Perl core or starting from
    which version only looked at the first Perl version. This ignored cases
    where a package was removed from core at some point.
    Change those methods to return if a module is not currently in Perl core.
    Thanks to Peter Valdemar MÃ¸rch for the bug report. (Closes: #788198)
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: don't enforce 9.20120312~ for
    debhelper in arch:any packages anymore. There is no older version in
    the archive anymore.

  [ Sean Whitton ]
  * Strip comments when reading control files.  (Closes: #823708)
    Otherwise, control files containing comments cause a parse failure.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  * Use HTTPS transport protocol for Format URI in copyright file.
    Refresh or create new copyright files using HTTPS transport protocol for
    the Format URI to the copyright format specification.
    Adjust tests to use HTTPS transport protocol as well in the Format
    fields.
  * Use HTTPS transport protocol for various URLs in POD

  [ Nick Morrott ]

    autopkgtest schema.
  * Add libmodule-build-perl to Recommends.

    This provides 2 new options: --install-build-deps and --install-deps,
    which install just those packages required for building, and install all
    related packages, respectively.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Bump oldstable perl version from 5.10.1 to 5.14.2.
  * Update documentation for the --bdepends, --bdependsi, --depends
    options. They add (build) dependencies to the automatically found
    packages since 0.49. (Cf. #813766)
  * Adjust to apt-file 3, which dropped its own cache of Contents files in
    favour of APT's cache.
    - use `apt-get indextargets' and `/usr/lib/apt/apt-helper cat-file' to
      find/read the Contents files
    - drop --apt-contents-dir and --sources-list command line options
    - update tests accordingly, including a fake apt-get to point to the test
      Contents files
    - bump versioned Recommends on apt-file to 3 and add apt (>= 1.1.8)
    Thanks to Niels Thykier for his help.

  * Not importing IO::Dir since I'm not using it
  * better handling of upstream-supplied debian/ directories.  If we are
    making a git repo I now remove debian/ directory if the upstream ships
    it. This goes into the 'master' branch, so the 'upstream' branch

    a cpan2dsc 'flavour' of dh-make-perl. If it is called by that name,
    the behaviour changes for easy .dsc creation.
  * Mention cpan2deb and cpan2dsc in the long description.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  * exclude README in the root directory from .docs "in 9x% we remove it
    from .docs afterwards" this change is a bit of a "big gun", because it
    doesn't really check if README is autogenerated, but hey, fixing a 90%

    also helps with the initial repository creation for Git
  * Do not die when the WNPP cache cannot be read, for example due to binary
    format change in Storable. Also, use platform-independent storage.
    Closes: #626987 - dh-make-perl: Debian::WNPP::Query does not correctly
    invalidate cache or use platform-netural Storable format
  * bump default debhelper compatibility level to 8
  * note oldstable has perl 5.10.0, not 5.8.8
  * apply a patch from Manfred Stock fixing AptContents not to miss
    alternative dependencies when a given module is found in more than one
    package. Closes: #622852
  * Use CPAN::Meta for processing META.* files, adding support for META.json.
  * When no META file is available, try parsing name and version from Build.PL
    before Makefile.PL. Closes: #589946
  * fix calls to extract_basic_copyright from File::Find::find to not chdir,
    fixing lookups for ./LICENSE, etc on refresh. Closes: #613606 -- Fails to
    correctly identify GPLv2 in RT::Authen::ExternalAuth v0.08 on refresh

  Added logic to parse special email change directives in the changelog
  so that the refresh command respects email changes.
      Debian bug #609409

  Changed regular expression in t/dists.t to allow .svn not ending in /

  Various fixes for t/dists.t:
    - Added fix for .svn at the end of a filename rather than the middle
    - Second /dev/null check was attempting to diff an undefined value
    - Setting PERL5LIB (unsatisfactory work around for system(dh-make-perl) )

  DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: Refer to "Debian systems" instead of
  "Debian GNU/Linux systems" in generated debian/copyright.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  Improve regular expression to not match fields in Makefile.PL as
  MIN_PERL_VERSION to determine the version of the package. Thanks to
  Andrew Ruthven for reporting.
      Debian bug #596025

  Update my email address.

  Debian::Control::FromCPAN: also check test_requires and build_requires for
  finding build dependencies

  [ Peter Pentchev ]
  My::Builder: fix a typo (raname -> rename).

  t/AptContents.t: fix a typo (fund -> found).

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  when looking for XS code, skip win32/ directories

  Skip non-existing APT source files
      Debian bug #557961

  Detect usage of 'Artistic License 2.0' and include the license text in
  debian/copyright; require Software::License
    (Closes: #589816)

  Clarify documentation about --cpan argument being module name
      Debian bug #602059

  Support distribution names as arguments to --cpan
      Debian bug #607998

  Fix tests to stringify when comparing overloaded objects with strings

  Control::Stanza: split dependency lists one package per line in order to
  make changes more VCS-friendly

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  dh --buildsystem=buildsystem needs at least debhelper (>= 7.3.7), add this
  rule to DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging.

  Bump versioned Build-Depends on debhelper to (>= 7.3.7) as needed
  for --buildsystem.

    die early if unable to determine distribution name or version.
        Debian bug #525847

    spelling fixes in POD and comments

    [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
    Do not require --cpan in addition to --pkg-perl when adding Vcs-* fields.

    Debian::Dependency: Recognize deprecated '<' and '>' relations.

    Debian::Dependency: Allow architecture restrictions in dependencies.
    For now this information is just ignored.

    DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging (set_package_name): Use package name
    specified by --packagename option. (Debian bug #584619)

    dh-make-perl: Fix spelling error ("intercepring" â "intercepting").

    Debian::WNPP::Query: Fix bugs_for_package method.

    Debian::Control::FromCPAN (discover_dependencies): Do not ignore results
    from Module::Depends::Intrusive. (Debian bug #587276)

    [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
    Add support of Breaks field for binary package stanzas in debian/control
    to Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary.

    Create packages with Standards-Version: 3.9.1.

    Fix sentences in texts for License stanzas of debian/copyright: Add full
    stop mark after sentences.

    Add explicit Link to versioned `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-1' as this 
    was added by base-files 5.8 (See debian bug #436105).

    Fix debian/copyright text templates in t/dist/Strange-0.1 and
    t/dist/Strange-2.1.

    Add support for perl_dbi addon for dh.

    Build-Depends only on perl when Build.PL and Module::Build is used,
    instead of an alternate Build-Depends on perl (>= 5.10) |
    libmodule-build-perl. This is as support for Etch is now discontinued and
    Lenny already contains perl (>= 5.10) (Debian bug #590114).

    [ Chris Butler ]
    Fixed DhMakePerl::Utils to cope with modules in Module::CoreList where the
    version is unspecified. (Debian bug #585755)

0.68 (2010-05-04)

    Build.PL: add no_index as an attempt to avoid PAUSE indexing private stuff

    My::Builder: 'orig' target now creates identical (hard-linked)
        DhMakePerl-VERSION.tar.gz and dh-make-perl_VERSION.orig.tar.gz files

    My::Builder: streamline messages in the 'dist' and 'orig' actions

    Control.t: ensure dependency fields are wrapped properly

    make: fix a typo (DpkgList -> DpkgLists). Thanks to Dominic Hargreaves
        Debian bug #580101

    modules_already_packaged: fix ModuleInfo instantiation

    Config: honour values given to the constructor

    DpkgLists.t: do not insist that '/bin/perl' (or the corresponding regex) is
        only in perl-base. Instead, ensure that 'perl-base' is present in the
        returned list. Debian bug #580025

    make: drop $VERSION; some POD rewrite (was a blind copy of DhMakePerl.pm)

0.67
    POD: drop "--" in front of the commands.
    refresh: ensure ->rules is there before attempting to fiddle quilt
        integration

    Add support for version relations in META

    Debian::Dependency now survives being given a string with leading spaces

    make: implement recursive making of missing dependencies when --recursive
        is given. (Debian bug #342751)

    FromCPAN: remove leading 'v' from versions

    add Debian::DpkgLists - 'dpkg -S' on steroids

    FromCPAN: use Debian::DpkgLists as a last resort. This allows finding
        dependencies that are present in locally-installed packages.
        (Debian bug #478781)

    Dependency: the 'ver' member is an instance of Dpkg::Version
        Use its ability to compare and drop Debian::Version

    Dependenc{y,ies}: reduce '--' to '-' in the NAME POD section

    make: try harder to discover already existing package by looking up
        distribution modules in APT contents and dpkg file lists.

    replace CPAN::Config->load with CPAN:Handle::Config->load
        the former seems obsolete and only warns:
            Dispatching deprecated method 'CPAN::Config::load' to
            CPAN::HandleConfig

    added README

    added xt/pod-spelling.t to help test POD spelling
